# Low Cost Alternative Ventilator Design

 ## A low cost alternative design for ventilator made using off the shelf components.
 
All the components used are easily available & can be bought online or from local market.

This design uses an Ambu bag in place of a compressor which works though as of now there is no feedback mechanism to check the pressure & adjust accordingly.

It works by compressing & releasing the Silicon Ambu bag to provide the pressurized air/oxygen.

  # Disclaimer
  
  This is only a build experiment & not a product.
  I have not consulted any professional during this build.
  
  To actually use this in a real sistuation it needs security checks with other modifications.
